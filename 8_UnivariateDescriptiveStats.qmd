### Measures of central tendency

length sum / length mean

#### Extras

What if we had some missing values because some participants did not reveal their age to the researchers? For example, what if we had

```{r}
ages <- c(18, 18, 19, 19, NA, NA) 

mean(ages, na.rm = TRUE)

sum(ages) / length(ages)

```
