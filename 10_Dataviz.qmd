# Data visualisation: The Gramma`R` of Graphics {#sec-DataViz}

One of the advantages of working in `R` is that it allows us to create highly customised graphs to visualise our data and the results of our statistical analyses. The **Grammar of Graphics** [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005] is a theoretical framework that defines a structured approach to building and understanding statistical graphics. We will focus on using the tidyverse package [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) [@Wickhamggplot2Elegantgraphics2016] to create effetive data visualisations. The {ggplot2} is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics (short: gg) syntax in `R`.

This chapter is divided into two parts: the first explains the [**syntax**](@sec-syntax) of the Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005] and how the {ggplot2} package works, while the second part focuses on the [**semantics**](@sect-semantics) of statistical graphics and provides an introduction to the many different types of data visualisations that can be created using the package.

### Chapter overview {.unnumbered}

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

-   Create and interpret bar plots to visualise categorical variables.
-   Create and interpret histograms, density plots, and violin plots to visualise continuous numeric variables.
-   Create and interpret boxplots to visualise the distribution of continuous numeric variables across different subsets of the data.
-   Create and interpret scatter plots to visualise correlations between pairs of numeric variables.
-   Create and interpret facetted plots to explore the relationship between three or more variables at once.
-   Create interactive plots for data exploration.

### Set-up and data import {.unnumbered}

::: callout-warning
### Prerequisites

This chapter assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of descriptive statistics explained in Chapter 8, and the use of the data wrangling functions introduced in Chapter 9.

All examples, tasks, and quiz questions are based on data from:

> Dąbrowska, Ewa. 2019. Experience, Aptitude, and Individual Differences in Linguistic Attainment: A Comparison of Native and Nonnative Speakers. Language Learning 69(S1). 72–100. <https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12323>.

Our starting point for this chapter is the wrangled combined dataset that we created and saved in Chapter @sec-DataWrangling. Follow the instructions in this chapter to create this `R` object or download `combined_L1_L2_data.rds` from [the textbook's GitHub repository](https://github.com/elenlefoll/RstatsTextbook/blob/main/data/processed/combined_L1_L2_data.rds){.uri}.
:::

Before we begin, we must load the `combined_L1_L2_data.rds` file that we created and saved in Chapter @sec-DataWrangling. This file contains the data of all the L1 and L2 participants of @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019. The categorical variables are stored as factors and obvious data entry inconsistencies and typos have been corrected (see Chapter @sec-DataWrangling).

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

Dabrowska.data <- readRDS(file = here("data", "processed", "combined_L1_L2_data.rds"))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(checkdown)
```

Check that your data is correctly imported by examining the output of `View(Dabrowska.data)` and `str(Dabrowska.data)`. Once you are satisfied that that's the case, we ready to get creative! 🎨

## The syntax of graphics {#sec-syntax}

The syntax of the Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005] is made up of **layers** (@fig-layers), which allow us to create highly effective and efficient data visualisations, while giving us lots of flexibility and control.

![The syntax of the Grammar of Graphics as visualised in the [QCBS R Workshop Series](https://r.qcbs.ca/workshop03/book-en/grammar-of-graphics-gg-basics.html) (CC-BY-NC-SA).](images/gglayers.png){#fig-layers width="559"}

The **data** layer and the **aesthetics** layer are compulsory as you cannot build a graph that does not map *some* data onto *some* visual aspect (= aesthetic) of a graph. The remaining layers are optional, but some are very important. In the following, we will explain how the **geometries**, **facet**, **scales**, **coordinates**, and **theme** layers are used to build and customise graphs using the {ggplot2} library in `R`.

### Aesthetics {#sec-aes}

As explained in the documentation, the `ggplot()` function[^10_dataviz-1] has two compulsory arguments. First, we must select the **data** that we want to visualise. Second, we must specify which variable(s) from the data should be mapped onto which visual property or **aesthetics** (short: `aes`) of the plot.

[^10_dataviz-1]: Note that the library is called "ggplot2", but its main function is called "ggplot".

> |------------------|-----------------|
> | ggplot {ggplot2} | R Documentation |
>
> ### Description
>
> `ggplot()` initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to declare the input data frame for a graphic and to specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent layers unless specifically overridden.
>
> ### Usage
>
> ```         
> ggplot(data = NULL, mapping = aes(), ...)
> ```

For example, to create a bar plot visualising the distribution of participants' occupational groups in the combined dataset from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 (`Dabrowska.data`), we need to map the `OccupGroup` variable from `Dabrowska.data` onto our plot's *x-*axis (`x`).

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Attempt to plot the distribution of participants' occupational groups in Dąbrowska (2019)"
#| label: "fig-EmptyBarplot"

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup))

```

As you can see from @fig-EmptyBarplot, however, running this code returns an empty plot: All we get is a grid background and a nicely labelled *x-*axis, but no data... Why might that be?  🤔

### Geometries {#sec-geoms}

The reason we are not seeing any data is that we have not yet specified with which kind of **geometry** (short: **geom**) we would like to plot the data. The {ggplot2} library features more than 30 different geom functions! They all begin with the prefix `geom_`. To create a bar plot showing participants' occupational groups, we need to add a `geom_bar()` **layer** to our empty `ggplot` object (see @fig-barplot1).

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of participants' occupational groups (C = clerical position, I = inactive (i.e., unemployed, retired, or homemakers), M = manual jobs, PS = professional-level job or studying for a degree)"
#| label: "fig-barplot1"

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Note that we use the `+` operator to *add* layers to `ggplot` objects. If we try to use the pipe operator (`|>`) *within* the `ggplot()` function, we will get an error message.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) |> 
  geom_bar()
```

```         
Error in `geom_bar()`: 
! `mapping` must be created by `aes()`. 
ℹ Did you use `%>%` or `|>` instead of `+`? 
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
```

### Statistics and labels {#sec-StatsLabs}

We now have a simple bar plot that represents the distribution of participants' occupational groups in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019. By default, the axis labels are simply the names of the variables that are mapped onto the plot's aesthetics. That's why, in @fig-barplot1, our *x*-axis is labelled "OccupGroup".

What about the *y*-axis? We did not specify a *y*-aesthetic within the mapping argument of our `ggplot()` object, yet the *y*-axis is labelled "count". This is because `geom_bar()` automatically computes a "count" **statistic** that gets mapped to the *y*-aesthetic.

If we want to change these axis labels, we can do so by adding a `labs()` **layer** to our plot (see @fig-BarOccupGroup).

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of participants' occupational groups (C = clerical position, I = inactive (i.e., unemployed, retired, or homemakers), M = manual jobs, PS = professional-level job or studying for a degree)"
#| label: "fig-BarOccupGroup"

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants")
```

```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### What is alt-text and why is it important?

**Alt-text**, or alternative text, is a concise description of an image used to make its informational content accessible to people with visual impairments. Using a screenreader programme, blind and visually impaired individuals can have the alt-text associated with an image read out to them.

A good alt-text aims to convey the main message and insights of the graph, allowing someone who cannot see it to understand the information being presented. In the context of online publications, alt-text is also useful in regions with low bandwidth as images may take a very long time to load. By including alt-text, we can therefore make our work more accessible and inclusive, enabling more people to engage with and understand our data and analyses.

<!--#  To do @Elen: Add alt-text task related to a plot from Chapter 8.-->
:::

### Data {#sec-ggplotData}

Instead of using the **data** argument of the `ggplot()` function as we did above, we can **pipe** the data into the function's first argument (see @sec-Piping). Compare these two methods and their outputs.

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Using the data argument of `ggplot()`**

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup))      +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants")
```
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Piping the data into `ggplot()`**

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants")
```
:::
::::::

You should have realised that the outputs are exactly the same. Piping the dataset into the `ggplot()` function, however, allows us to easily wrangle the data that we want to visualise 'on the fly', without transforming the data object itself. For example, we can use the tidyverse `filter()` function (see @sec-filter) to examine the distribution of occupational groups among L2 participants only (see @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "2,7"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants",
       title = "Occupational groups of L2 participants")
```

We can also combine several `filter()` conditions using the `&` (AND) and `|` (OR) operators. For example, we may want to visualise the distribution of the occupational groups of participants who are L2 speakers or English *and* whose first language is Polish (see @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "2,7"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2" & NativeLg == "Polish") |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants",
       title = "Occupational groups of Polish L1 participants")
```

### Facets {#sec-facets}

If we want to compare two subsets of the data, we can add a **facet layer** to subdivide the plot into several plots each representing a subset of the data. In the following, we use the `facet_wrap()` function to subdivide our bar plot by the `Group` variable (`~ Group`). This allows us to easily compare the distribution of occupations across L1 and the L2 participants (see @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "4"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants",
       title = "Occupational groups of participants")
```

To compare the distributions of occupations of the male and female L2 participants, we can combine a `filter()` operation to select only the L2 participants, with a `facet_wrap()` layer (see @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "2,5"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Participants",
       title = "Occupational groups of L2 participants")
```

To explore potential gender differences in occupational groups across both L1 and L2 groups, we can combine the two variables within the `facet_wrap()` function (see @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "4"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Group + Gender) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Participants")
```

### Scales {#sec-scales}

**Scale** layers allow us to map data values to the visual values of an aesthetic. For example, to make our facetted plot in @fig-\*\* <!--# @Vishar: plot above --> easier to read, we could add some colour using a **fill** aesthetic to fill each bar with a colour that corresponds to the participants' gender. To do so, we map each unique value of the variable `Gender` ("F" and "M") onto a colour that is then used to fill the corresponding bars of our bar plot. Adding the **fill** aesthetic automatically generates a legend (see fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "3"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, 
                       fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Group + Gender) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Participants")
```

As we did not specify any **fill** colours for @fig-\*\*, {ggplot2} used default colours taken from the {scales} package of the tidyverse environment. This is because, in the Grammar of Graphics, colour palettes are governed by **scales**. To specify a different set of colours, we therefore need to specify a **scale layer**.

One way to do this is to use `scale_fill_manual()` to manually pick our own colours, either using [`R` colour codes](https://r-charts.com/colors/) (such as `purple`) or [hexadecimal colour codes](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) (such as `#34027d`). Note that both types of colour codes must be enclosed in quotation marks.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "A facetted bar plot with hand-picked colours"
#| label: "fig-PurpleBarplot"
#| source-line-numbers: "3,8"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, 
                       fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Group + Gender) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Participants") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "#34027d"))
```

Although it makes the plot easier to interpret, the colour aesthetic (here `fill`) is not strictly necessary to understand the data represented in @fig-PurpleBarplot. After all, the two `gender` subgroups are already distinguished by the `facet_wrap()` layer. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you must consider whether such redundant elements facilitate the interpretation of the data visualised or not.

In some cases, colour is used as the *only* way of identifying subgroups in the data, for example in a **stacked bar plot** (see @fig-ColourBarplot). In such cases, it is important to consider how the plot will be perceived by different people (see note on colour blindness below).

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "A bar plot with the default {ggplot2} colours"
#| label: "fig-ColourBarplot"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, 
                       fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Participants") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "#34027d"))
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### A note on colours and colour blindness 🌈

Colour blindness is a condition that results in a decreased ability to see colours and perceive differences in colour. There are different types of colour blindness but, in general, it is best to avoid red-green contrasts. To ensure that your data visualisations are accessible to as many people as possible, you may want to use the [{colorBlindness}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorBlindness/vignettes/colorBlindness.html) package [@ouColorBlindnessSafeColor2021] to simulate the appearance of a set of colours for people with different forms of colour blindness.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

#install.packages("colorBlindness")
library(colorBlindness)

colorBlindness::displayAllColors(scales::hue_pal()(6))

```

Using the {colorBlindness} package, we can immediately see that the default {scales} discrete palette that {ggplot2} used in @fig-ColourBarplot is not accessible to colour blind people (deuteranope and protanope), nor is it distinguishable when printed in grey-scale (desaturate). In contrast, our hand-picked colours from @fig-\*\* fare much better.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

colorBlindness::displayAllColors(c("pink", "#34027d"))
```

But you need not manually pick colours, as many people have developed and shared `R` packages that feature attractive, ready-to-use colour-blind friendly palettes. The [{viridis}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) package [@garnierSjmgarnierViridisCRAN2023], for example, includes eight such palettes ("magma", "inferno", "plasma", "cividis", "rocket", "turbo") that also reproduce well in grey-scale. And, as it is included in the {ggplot2} installation, you don't even need to install the {viridis} package separately!

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

colorBlindness::displayAllColors(viridis::viridis(6))
```

Choosing an appropriate palette is not the only way to make your visualisations accessible to colour-blind readers. Another way is to provide redundant mappings to other aesthetics such size, line type, shape, or pattern (see @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show {ggplot2} code to generate @fig-**"
#| fig-height: 5

#install.packages("ggpattern")
library(ggpattern)

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, 
                       fill = Gender,
                       pattern = Gender)) +
  geom_bar_pattern(pattern_density = 0.01,  # adjust for better visibility
                   pattern_fill = "transparent",  # keeps pattern visible
                   pattern_colour = "grey") +  # pattern lines color
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Participants") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "#34027d")) +
  scale_pattern_manual(values = c("stripe", "crosshatch")) # specify types of patterns

# Note: If you get the error message "Error in seq.default(from, to, by) : invalid '(to - from)/by'" when trying to run this chunk of code, this is because your Plots pane in RStudio is not large enough to accommodate the plot. Increase its size and it should work (see also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73960726/error-in-seq-defaultfrom-to-by-invalid-to-from-by-ggpattern).
```

Finally, it is important to remember that colour blindness is by no means the only type of visual impairment you should consider when creating visualisations. Wordlwide, far more people are affected by **blindness** and **low vision**. Chapter 13 explains how to add **alternative texts** (alt text) to plots and images. Many people with visual impairments rely on screen readers that use these alternative texts to provide audio descriptions of images and plots. These alternative texts can also improve the user experience when there are internet connection issues and images do not load properly or quickly enough.
:::

Some academic publishers still require grey-scale plots, in which case you will want to use the **scale** layer `scale_fill_grey()`. Alternatively, the colour palettes of the {viridis} package (see information box on colour blindness) render well in grey, too. The {viridis} function for a discrete colour scale (as needed for a categorical variable such as `Gender`) can be called up using the `scale_fill_viridis_d()` function. With the "option" argument, you can switch between eight different viridis palettes ("magma", "inferno", "plasma", "cividis", "rocket", "turbo").

If you like colours, check out the {paletteer} package [@hvitfeldtPaletteerComprehensiveCollection2021], which provides a neat interface to access a very large collection of `R` colour packages, some of which are very fun! The advantage is that you only need to install one package (`install.packages("paletteer")`) to have a huge range of palettes at our disposal. Below is a small selection of some personal favourites.

### Themes {#sec-themes}

The {ggplot2} framework also allows for the addition of an optional `theme()` **layer** to further customise the look of plots. The default {ggplot2} theme is `theme_grey()`. Here are some of the pre-built themes that come with the {ggplot2} library for you to compare. As with colour palettes, you can install additional libraries that will give you access to literally hundreds of ready-made themes for you to explore.

Pretty much all aspects of plot themes can be customised. To demonstrate this, @fig-SillyTheme displays a bar plot with some highly customised aesthetics. I will let you judge how meaningful these custom choices are and whether they genuinely help the reader to interpret the data... 🤨

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Illustration of some of the customisation options of `ggplot` objects"
#| label: fig-SillyTheme
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "See {ggplot2} code used to generate this plot."

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Occupational group",
       y = "Number of participants",
        title = "An example of an extravagantly customised ggplot...") +
    theme(
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#FFC080", color = NA),
      panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gold", linewidth = 1.5),
      panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "grey20", linewidth = 0.5),
      axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12, color = "brown", angle = 10),
      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 25, color = "green", family = "Courier New"),
      axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic", size = 12, color = "cyan"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14, color = "grey"),
      plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10, color = "purple", family = "Comic Sans MS")
      )

```

### Coordinates {#sec-coordinates}

By default, the coordinate system that is used in `ggplot` objects is the **Cartesian coordinate system**, which has a horizontal axis (*x*) and a vertical axis (*y*) that are perpendicular to each other. To change this default Cartesian coordinate system, we need to add a **coordinate layer**.

For example, if we want to display the full names of the four occupational groups used in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, we can use change the labels of the categories using `mutate()` and `fct_recode()` *before* pipping the data into `ggplot()` (see @sec-ggplotData) and then flip the *x* and *y* axes using the coordinate layer `coord_flip()`. As shown in @fig-\*\*, this makes long labels much easier to read.

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "2-6,13"
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3.5

Dabrowska.data |> 
  mutate(OccupGroup = fct_recode(OccupGroup,
                                 `Professionally inactive` = "I",
                                 `Clerical profession` = "C",
                                 `Manual profession` = "M",
                                 `Professional-level job/\nstudent` = "PS")) |> 
  mutate(Gender = fct_rev(Gender)) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Participants") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12))
```

The vast majority of statistical graphs use the Cartesian coordinate system. Pie charts and other circular plots, however, use the **polar coordinate system** (`coord_polar`), whereby quantities are mapped onto angles rather distances. In general, humans are much better at judging lengths than angles or areas [@clevelandGraphicalPerceptionVisual1987], which is why circular graphs such as pie charts are typically *not* recommended forms of good data visualisations [see, e.g., @fewPiesDessert]. That said, they *can* be produced using the {ggplot2} library by adding the **coordinate** layer `coord_polar("y")` and modifying a few parameters.

```{r}
#| source-line-numbers: "8-13"
#| fig-height: 4

Dabrowska.data |> 
  mutate(OccupGroup = fct_recode(OccupGroup,
                                 `Professionally inactive` = "I",
                                 `Clerical profession` = "C",
                                 `Manual profession` = "M",
                                 `Professional-level job/\nstudent` = "PS")) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = "", fill = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  labs(fill = "Occupational group") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1) +

  theme_void()
```

## The semantics of graphics {#sec-semantics}

So far, we have seen how the syntax of the Grammar of Graphics can be used to build statistical graphs layer by layer. We now turn to the **semantics** of graphics. As linguists are well placed to know, semantics is the study of **meaning**. In the Grammar of Graphics, the semantics of graphics is defined as "the meanings of the representative symbols and arrangements we use to display information" [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005: 20]. In what follows, we will see how thinking about the semantics of graphics can help us to think about how the different components of a graph interact to convey insightful visual information from raw data. This will help us to make informed choices when choosing the geometries, scales, facets, and themes of our data visualisations.

But, first, let's think about **why** we visualise data. Data visualisation is about more than just communicating the results of our analyses to **others** at the publication stage. In fact, good data visualisation can help **us** make informed decisions throughout the research process from the data wrangling stage to the evaluation of complex statistical models. Here are some reasons for visualising data. Can you think of others? 🤔

Stylized text reads “ggplot2: visual data exploration.”"}

Depending on the type of data that we want to visualise and why, we can choose different types of plots. In the following, we will first look at how we can plot **categorical variables** and **discrete numeric variables**, before we move on to visualising **continuous numeric variables** and combinations of different types of variables (see @sec-types-of-variables).

### Bar plots

As we saw in @sec-syntax, bar plots (also called **bar charts**) are a great way to visualise **categorical variables**. We also saw that, when using horizontal writing systems, it is often easier to interpret a bar plot if its coordinates are flipped so that longer labels can be read more readily.

Study @fig-\*\* and think about which {ggplot2} functions were used to generate it. 🤔

Then, click on the "Show `R` code" button to compare your intuitions with the actual code. Note that there may well be more than one solution: So do try out your version and see if spot any differences!
:::

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show `R` code."
#| fig-width: 9

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  mutate(NativeLg = fct_rev(fct_infreq(NativeLg))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = NativeLg, 
           fill = NativeLgFamily)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "F") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 40)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = NULL, 
       y = NULL, 
       fill = "Language family",
       title = "Native languages of L2 participants") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

To create @fig-\*\*, we first reordered the factor levels of the `NativeLg` variable using two functions from the {forcats} package (see @sec-forcats): `fct_infreq()` is first used to order the factors according to their frequency (by default, they are sorted alphabetically), and then `fct_rev()` is used to reverse that order. The latter step is needed because the `coord_flip()` functions reverses everything. You can check the order of a factor's level using the function `levels()`. Note that, if two levels have the same number of occurrences, they are ordered alphabetically (as seen in @fig-\*\*).

```{r}
levels(Dabrowska.data$NativeLg)

levels(fct_infreq(Dabrowska.data$NativeLg))

levels(fct_rev(fct_infreq(Dabrowska.data$NativeLg)))

### Histograms {#sec-histograms}

In @sec-DistributionsNumeric, we visually examined the distribution of participants' ages in a **bar plot**. This was possible because the age variable in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 was recorded as a discrete numeric variable (i.e. either as 18 or 19, but not 18.4 years of age).

```{r}
ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(Age)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Bar charts are best suited for categorical data and should only be used to visualise discrete numeric variables that have a fairly limited number of possible values. As we can see from the output of the `unique()` function, this is not the case for the `Age` variable in `Dabrowska.data`, as it includes `r length(unique(Dabrowska.data$Age))` different age values, ranging from `r min(Dabrowska.data$Age)` to `r max(Dabrowska.data$Age)`.

```{r}
unique(Dabrowska.data$Age) |> 
  sort()
```

The distribution of participants' ages is therefore better visualised as a histogram or density plot. To visualise participants' age as **histogram** rather than as a bar plot, all we need to do is change the plot geometry (see @sec-geoms) from `geom_bar()` to `geom_histogram()`.

```{r}
#| message: true

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Age (in years)",
       y = "Number of participants") +
  theme_minimal()
```

When generating this histogram, a message appears in the `R` console that informs us that, by default, the `geom_histogram()` function subdivided the `Age` values into 30 **bins**. This means that the age range from `r min(Dabrowska.data$Age)` to `r max(Dabrowska.data$Age)` has been subdivided into 30 groups of equal size. Given that there is a range of 48 in the `Age` values in this dataset, this is not a great way to subdivide the values of this variable.

As indicated in the message, to change this behaviour, we can adjust the value of the "binwidth" argument. This argument determines how many years go in each bin. So if we choose to have two years in each subdivision of the `Age` variable, we will end up with 24 bins. Logically, if we decide to group four years in each subdivision of the `Age` variable, we will end up with just 12 bins.

Compare the three histograms below. In your opinion, which binwidth provides the most effective way to visualise the distribution of participants' ages? 🤔

### Density plots {#sec-Density}

An alternative to displaying the data in discrete bins is to apply a density function to smooth over the bins of the histogram. This is what we call a density plot. @fig-GrammarDensity is a density plot of participants' grammar test scores.

Create density plots in `R` using {ggplot2} is very simple. Because, yes, you've guessed it: there's a `geom_` function for density plots and it's called... `geom_density()`! 😃

```{r}
#| label: "fig-GrammarDensity"
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of English vocabulary test results" 
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5

ggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,
       mapping = aes(x = Grammar)) +
  geom_density(fill = "purple") +
  labs(x = "Scores on English grammar test") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Density plots are particularly useful to examine distribution shapes visually. Looking at @fig-GrammarDensity, we can immediately see that the values of the `Grammar` variable are not normally distributed (see @sec-DistributionsNumeric).

#### Going further: Setting properties within geoms

You can change attributes of a layer by specifying them as arguments within a specific `geom_` function.

The help file of each `geom_` function provides a list of the aesthetics arguments that each function has (see below). Aesthetics that must be provided for a function to work are marked in bold, whilst the others are optional. Here, the required arguments are taken directly from the `aes` values specified for the entire plot and therefore need not be specified again within the `geom_density()` function. If we do not specify any of the optional aesthetics of the `geom_` functions, sensible default values will be used. For instance, the line colour of density plots will be black, unless otherwise specified with the argument "colour".

@fig-\*\* is an example of a density plot with some highly customised aesthetics. It goes without saying that, just because you *can* customise many aesthetic aspects of a `geom_` layer, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good idea to do so! 🙃

```{r}
Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Blocks)) +
    geom_density(colour = "purple",
                linewidth = 1.5,
                linetype = "dotdash",
                fill = "pink",
                alpha = 0.8,
                ) +
    labs(x = "Non-verbal IQ test (Blocks) results")
```

It can, however, be very useful to help identify different elements within a complex plot as in @fig-\*\*.

```{r}
mean.blocks <- Dabrowska.data |>
  group_by(Group) |>
  summarise(mean = mean(Blocks))

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Blocks, 
                       fill = Group,
                       colour = Group)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, 
               position = "identity") +
  geom_vline(data = mean.blocks, 
             aes(xintercept = mean, 
                 colour = Group), 
             linetype = "dashed",
             linewidth = 0.8) +
  theme_bw()
```

Note that, to create @fig-\*\*, we first calculated the mean Blocks scores for both L1 and L2 participants and stored these values in a new object called `mean.blocks`. These values are then called within the `geom_vline()` function, which draws vertical lines. In other words, in addition to setting `aes()` mappings within the `ggplot()` function, we can also add additional data mappings within a specific `geom_` function. It's no exaggeration to say that, with {ggplot2}, pretty much anything is possible!
:::

### Boxplots

In @sec-IQR, we saw that **boxplots** are a great way to visualise both the central tendency (median) of a numeric variable and the spread around this central tendency (IQR). There is an in-built function to create boxplots in {ggplot2}. No prizes will be awarded for guessing that the necessary `geom_` function is called... `geom_density()`! 😆

Whilst it's possible to plot just a single boxplot, that rarely makes sense. In fact, the `x`-axis in @fig-\*\* is entirely nonsensical! The distribution of `Grammar` scores across the entire dataset is much better visualised as a histogram or density plot (see @sec-Density) than as a single boxplot.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 4

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(y = "Grammar scores")

```

If, however, we want to compare the `Grammar` scores of two or more different groups of participants, a boxplot makes a lot more sense (see @fig-\*\*). To achieve this, we add a second argument within the `aes()` function, which maps the values of the `Group` variable (which are either "L1" or "L2") to the plot's `x`-axis.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 5

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Grammar scores")
```

The meaning conveyed by @fig-\*\* is clear: there is hardly any difference between the average (median) grammar comprehension test scores of L1 and L2 participants in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's dataset. Indeed, we can see that the thicker, middle lines within each boxplot are almost at the same level. However, the two boxplots have very different shapes and overall lengths: the scores of the 50% of L2 participants who scored below the median are much more spread out than those of the L1 participants who obtained below-average scores. This makes intuitive sense: native English speakers living in the UK who volunteer for such a study are likely to all have a fairly high to very high understanding of English grammar. By contrast, the L2 speakers are much more varied: some are highly proficient in English, while others are not. This range of proficiency could due to all sorts of reasons.

What are some of the possible reasons that you can think of? 🤔 Make a note of them as we will explore these hypotheses further in @sec-Scatterplots.

#### Going further: Dot plots and violin plots

The {ggplot2} library offers many more `geom_` functions for you to explore. Here are two more types of graphs that are currently only rarely used in the language sciences, but which can be very effective ways to visualise the distribution of a numeric variable across different levels of a categorical variable.

##### Dot plots

In a dot plot, each data point (corresponding, here, to a single participant) is represented by a single dot. The size of each dot corresponds to the chosen **bin width**. This makes dot plots a combination of a boxplot (see @sec-boxplots) and a histogram (see @sec-histograms).

    labs(y = "Grammar comprehension scores",
         x = NULL) +
    theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```

##### Violin plots

The help file of the `geom_violin()` function describes violin plots as follows:

> A violin plot is a compact display of a continuous distribution. It is a blend of [`geom_boxplot()`](http://127.0.0.1:19143/help/library/ggplot2/help/geom_boxplot) and [`geom_density()`](http://127.0.0.1:19143/help/library/ggplot2/help/geom_density): a violin plot is a mirrored density plot displayed in the same way as a boxplot.

By themselves, **violin plots** are rather abstract representations of variable distributions (see @fig-\*\* <!--# @Vishar, this should be the plot above -->. However, in combination with **boxplots**, they can be an effective way to visualise and compare data distributions. Note that, here, the order of the layers is important because, if we first draw the boxplots and then the violin plots, the violin plots will mask the boxplots completely.

### Scatter plots {#sec-Scatterplots}

Scatter plots are ideal to examine the relationship between two numeric variables. They are best suited to continuous numeric variables.

In the following, we will build a scatter plot to explore the following hypothesis:

-   In the data from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, English grammar comprehension scores are more strongly associated with the level of formal education among L2 speakers than among L1 speakers.

To explore this hypothesis, we map the total number of years that participants spent in formal education (`EduTotal`) onto the *x*-axis and their `Grammar` scores onto the *y*-axis. In addition, we use the `facet_wrap()` function to split the data into two panels: one for the L1 participants and the other for the L2 group.

```{r}
Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = EduTotal, 
                     y = Grammar)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Number of years in formal education",
       y = "Grammar comprehension test scores",
       title = "Exploring hypothesis 1") +
  theme_bw()
```

At first glance, it would seem that our data does not support our initial hypothesis: among the L2 participants, there is no obvious trend suggesting that those who scored lowest on the grammar test were the ones who spent fewer years in formal education.-

In @fig-\*\*, we add a regression line (in blue) per panel to our facetted scatter plot using the `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` function. This allows us to visualise the **correlation** between participants' grammar scores and the number of years they spent in formal education. Regression lines in scatter plots are interpreted as follows:

-   If the regression line goes up, there is a **positive correlation** between the two numeric variables. ↗️
-   If the line goes down, there is a **negative correlation**. ↘️
-   The steeper the line, the stronger the correlation. 💪
-   If the line is flat (or nearly flat), there is no (linear) correlation between the two variables. ➡️
-   Be aware that even very strong correlations do not necessarily imply (direct) causation. ❌

```{r}
Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = EduTotal, 
                       y = Grammar)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Number of years in formal education",
       y = "Grammar comprehension test scores",
       title = "Exploring hypothesis 1") +
  theme_bw()
```

The regression lines added by the `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` function are **lines of best fit**: the better the fit, the closer the points are to the line. If few points are on or close to the line, it means that the regression line is not a good approximation of the relationship between the two variables. This is clearly the case in @fig-\*\* - especially in the L2 panel (more on this in @sec-Correlations). Our data visualisation therefore do not support our hypothesis that, in the @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 data, grammar scores are more strongly associated with the level of formal education among the L2 speakers than among the L1 speakers. If anything, our data shows the opposite pattern! Our line of fit is both closer to the data points and steeper in the L1 panel than in the L2 panel.

So far, all of our data visualisations have only displayed the characteristics of the collected data. In other words, they display **descriptive statistics** (see Chapter 8) that do not allow us to make inferences about other participants who were not tested as part of @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's study. Tests of statistical significance, including of correlations, are introduced in the following chapter.

#### Task {.unnumbered}

In this task, you will explore another hypothesis:

> L2 speakers' grammar comprehension scores (`Grammar`) are positively correlated with their length of residence in the UK (`LoR`): L2 speakers who have lived in the UK for longer have a better understanding than those who arrived more recently.

Using {ggplot2}, create a **scatter plot** that allows you to explore this hypothesis.

Identifying outliers is important to check and understand our data. If we spot an outlier corresponding to a participant having lived in a country for 400 years, we can immediately tell that something has gone wrong during data collection and/or pre-processing. In this case, however, common sense tells us that it is prefectly possible to have lived 40+ years in a country.

### Word clouds

The {ggplot2} library does not include an in-built function to create word clouds. However, members of the `R` community are continously creating and sharing new functions and packages to improve and extend data visualisation options in `R`. One such community member, Erwan Le Pennec, created the [{ggwordcloud}](https://lepennec.github.io/ggwordcloud/) package, which adds the `geom_text_wordcloud()` function to the {ggplot2} environment.

::: column-margin
![Hex sticker of the [{ggwordcloud}](https://lepennec.github.io/ggwordcloud/) package](images/hex_ggwordcloud.png){#fig-hexggwordcloud width="100" fig-alt="The hexagonal logo of the ggwordcloud package which features a cartoonish white cloud on a sky-blue blackground."}
:::

```{r}
#install.packages("ggwordcloud")
library(ggwordcloud)
```

We will use the `geom_text_wordcloud()` function to create a word cloud representing L2 participants' native languages. To this end, we first need to create a table that tallies how often each native language was mentioned. We also include a column for the language family (see Task 9.3 in @sec-using-case_when).

```{r}
NativeLg_freq <- Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  count(NativeLg, NativeLgFamily)

NativeLg_freq
```

Next, we enter this new dataset, `NativeLg_freq`, in a `ggplot()` function and map each native language to a text `label` **aesthetics**, the number of participants to have this native language to the `size` of the words, and each native language family to a `colour`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(13)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = NativeLg_freq,
       aes(label = NativeLg,
           size = n,
           colour = NativeLgFamily)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 30) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Word clouds are widely used in the media and corporate world, but they are much rarer in academic research. Although word clouds can help us to quickly perceive the most prominent words in a set of words, they are mostly serve decorative purposes. Data visualisation experts warn against them for two main reasons:

-   Longer words appear larger simply due to their length.
-   The human eye is not good at discerning small differences in font sizes.

:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Going further: Using `geom_text()`

We have seen that, on a scatter plot, each point represents an observation, in our case, a participant. For instance, in @fig-\*\*, each point represents an L2 participant and displays their age and grammar comprehension test score. In addition, we can colour the points according to their native language family.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "See `R` code."
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 8

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, 
           y = Grammar,
           colour = NativeLgFamily)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score", 
       color = "Language family") +
  theme_bw()
```

Instead of plotting points on the scatter plot, we can plot text. Thus, instead of using `geom_point()`, we can use `geom_text()`. For example, we can display the native language of each participant by mapping `NativeLg` to the `label` aesthetics.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "See `R` code."
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 8
#| source-line-numbers: "6-7"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, 
           y = Grammar,
           colour = NativeLgFamily,
           label = NativeLg)) +
  geom_text() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(15,65)) +
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score", 
       color = "Language family") +
  theme_bw()
```

Clearly, there are too many L2 participants for fig-\*\* <!--# @Vishar, plot above --> to be legible. For now, we will therefore focus on female L2 participants only. Moreover, we can see that there is dense cluster of L2 participants who are young and scored very high on the grammar comprehension test. In this exploratative analysis, we will therefore focus on female participants who obtained fewer than 90 points on the test.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "See `R` code."
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 8
#| source-line-numbers: "3,13"

Dabrowska.data |> 
  filter(Group == "L2") |> 
  filter(Grammar < 90 & Gender == "F") |> 
ggplot(aes(x = Age, 
           y = Grammar,
           colour = NativeLgFamily,
           label = NativeLg)) +
  geom_text() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(15,55)) +
  labs(x = "Age", 
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score", 
       color = "Language family",
       caption = "(Subgroup analysis of female L2 participants with grammar scores below 90.)") +
  theme_bw()
```

Note that we had to expand the limits of the *x*-axis in order for labels of the youngest and oldest participants to be displayed in full on fig-\*\*. Still, there are a few labels that overlap nonetheless. If this bothers you, you'll be pleased to hear that there is a handy {ggplot2} extension called {[ggrepel](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html)}, which was designed to avoid text labels overlapping.

### Combining `geoms_` and `aes` {#sec-CombiningGeoms}

Part of the magic of the Grammar of Graphics is that we can easily combine **different geometries** and **aesthetics** to create highly informative graphs. For example, we can combine `geom_boxplot()` with `geom_point()` to see both the characteristics of the distributions of grammar test scores among L1 and L2 participants, as well as exact score of each individual participant. By default, the `geom_boxplot()` function plots dots for any outliers. Since we are now also plotting *all* the data points using the `geom_point()` function, we need to switch off this option, otherwise the outliers will be plotted twice.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 4

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6,
             size = 2) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score") +
  theme_bw()
```

When there are too many points overlapping, even adding some transparency to the points with the `alpha` option (`alpha = 0` means fully transparent; `alpha = 1` means no transparency at all) may not suffice to tell the points apart. An alternative is to add a little bit of randomness to the position of the dots using the `geom_jitter()` function to ensure that there are fewer overlaps.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 4
#| source-line-numbers: "5-7"

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.6,
              size = 2,
              width = 0.1) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score") +
  theme_bw()
```

We can also map the colour of the jittered points to another categorical variable from our dataset, e.g., `Gender`.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5
#| source-line-numbers: "4"

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group, 
                       colour = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE,
               colour = "black") +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.6,
              size = 2,
              width = 0.1) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score") +
  theme_bw()
```

@fig-\*\* allows us to see that the lowest grammar comprehension test scores among L1 participants come from male participants, whereas the lowest scores in the L2 group come from female participants. Can you think of why this might be? 🤔 Make a note of your hypothesis as you will have a chance to explore further in @sec-InteractivePlots.

We can, in theory, visualise even more of our data by adding a **shape** `aesthetics` to the `geom_jitter()` (see @fig-\*\*). However, increased plot complexity does not necessarily result in more meaningful or effective statistical graphics. How effective is @fig-\*\*, in your opinion?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5
#| source-line-numbers: "7"

Dabrowska.data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group, 
                       colour = OccupGroup)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "black",
               outliers = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(shape = Gender),
              size = 3,
              alpha = 0.7, 
              width = 0.1) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score",
       colour = "Occupational\ngroup") +
  theme_bw()
```

As the saying goes, less is often more. In other words, simpler plots are often more effective than complex ones. With {ggplot2} and its many extensions, the possibilities are almost endless, but that doesn't mean that simple bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots should be abandoned! When designing effective data visualisation to communicate your research, think carefully about your **audience** and the **message** that you want to convey.

## Interactive plots {#sec-InteractivePlots}

In @sec-CombiningGeoms, we saw that we can combine **geometries** and **aesthetics**, but that there are some limits as to what is meaningful and effective. In particular, it is difficult to visualise categorical variables with many different levels on a static graph.

The good news is that now that you know how to create a plot using {ggplot2}, you are 10 seconds away from making it interactive! Interactive plots are particularly useful for **data sanity checks** and **data exploration**.

:::

The [{plotly}](https://plotly-r.com) package provides access to a popular javascript visualisation toolkit with an `R` interface. You will first need to install the package and load it.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(plotly)
```

Then, all you need to do is create and save a `ggplot` object, and call that object with the `ggplotly()` function. In RStudio, your interactive plot will be displayed in the Viewer pane. Hover your mouse over the data points of @fig-\*\* to explore the data interactively. You will see that the variable mapped onto the `label` aesthetics (`OccupGroup`) appears when you hover the mouse over any single data point.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| source-line-numbers: "1,15"

myplot <- Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group, 
                       colour = Gender,
                       label = Occupation)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.8, 
              width = 0.1) +

       y = "Grammar comprehension test score") +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(myplot)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

# There is a well-known but, as of yet, unresolved bug in the plotly library, which means that the geom_boxplot() parameter "outliers = FALSE" is ignored in the interactive version of the plot. Below, I apply the workaround explained here: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/issues/1114.

myplot <- Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group,

If you want to display more than one additional variable on hover, you can do using the `text` mapping. Here you can customise which variables are displayed and how.

```{r}
#| eval: false

  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, 
                       x = Group, 
                       colour = Gender,
                       text = paste("Age:", Age,
                                    "</br>Years in formal education:", EduTotal,
                                     "</br>Job:", Occupation))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.8, 
              width = 0.1) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0, 
               colour = "black",
               outliers = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Grammar comprehension test score") +

## Exporting plots

You may want to share the plots that you have created in `R` with others or insert them in a research paper or presentation. {ggplot2} provides a convenient way to export plots in various formats using the `ggsave()` function. You can specify the file name, format, and other options such as the width, height, and resolution of the image.

If you run the `ggsave()` function without specifying which plot should be saved, it will save the last plot that was displayed. The image file type is determined by the extension of the file name that you provide, e.g., a file name ending in `.png` will export your graph to a PNG file. You can specify its dimensions in centimetres (`cm`), millimetres (`mm`), inches (`in`), and pixel (`px`).

```{r}
#| eval: false

Dabrowska.data |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Blocks,
                       fill = Group)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "Non-verbal IQ (Blocks test)") +
  theme_bw()

ggsave("BlocksDensityPlot.png",
       width = 10,
       height = 8,
       units = "cm")
```

By default, plots will be exported to the project's working directory. You can save it elsewhere by specifying a different file path (see @sec-Paths). For example, this function will save the last plot displayed as an SVG file in the project's subfolder "figures". Note that, if the subfolder to which you want to save your graph does not yet exist, `R` will return an error. So make sure that the subfolder exists at the path that you specified before attempting to save anything in it!

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggsave("figures/BlocksDensityPlot.svg",
       width = 1500,
       height = 1000,
       units = "px")
```

### Going further: Plotting your way to success 📈 {.unnumbered collapse="TRUE"}

If you have completed this chapter, you can now produce some of the most widely used graphs in the language sciences: Congratulations!

Bar plots, boxplots, scatter plots, density plots and histograms may well be all that you need for now. But you should know that the possibilities with `R`, the {ggplot2} library, and its many extensions are pretty much limitless: The [`R` Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) lists some 50 different types of charts with over 400 examples with code! Another great resource is [The R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang. To go beyond the basics and to find out more information about the theoretical underpinnings of the {ggplot2} package, I recommend [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org). There are also great `R` packages to produce more specialised types of graphs frequently used in linguistics such as vowel charts and dialectal maps (see Appendix A).
