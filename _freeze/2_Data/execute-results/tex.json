You will learn about:\n\n-   Different types of data used in language research\n-   Computer data formats and file extensions\n-   Sharing and accessing research data and materials\n-   Working with delimiter-separated values (DSV) files\n-   The pitfalls of spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel, Numbers, and Google Sheets\n\nAlong the way, you will get insights into an eye-tracking study involving cute Playmobil figures and a meta-science investigation that highlights the utmost importance of data literacy for research.\n\n## Data in the language sciences {#sec-DataLanguageSciences}\n\nIn this book, we are concerned with empirical research in the language sciences, in other words, with research that is based on the analysis of **data**. But what is data exactly? Data can be collected via surveys, measurements, or observations. To begin with, however, these collected datasets are \"raw\". Data only becomes **information** once we have analysed and interpreted the data in a meaningful way. Hence, just like uncooked pasta does not make a flavourful meal, we must learn to \"cook\" the raw data to obtain meaningful information.\n\nWhat kind of data are analysed in the language sciences? To get a rough idea of the range of data types analysed in the language sciences, let us take a look at the [IRIS database](https://iris-database.org).\n\n> IRIS is a collection of instruments, materials, stimuli, data, and data coding and analysis tools used for research into languages, including first, second, and beyond, and signed language learning, multilingualism, language education, language use, and language processing. Materials are freely accessible and searchable, easy to upload (for contributions) and download (for use). [@IRIS2011]\n\nAs such, IRIS supports Open Science and Open Scholarship (see @sec-OpenScholarship).\n\n::: callout-caution\n#### Task 2.1\n\nIn this task and many future tasks, we will make use of the IRIS database.\n\n-   Connect to the [IRIS website](https://iris-database.org/) and navigate to its [Search and Download](https://iris-database.org/search) page.\n-   Scroll down to the filter option 'Data Type'.\n-   Click on 'Data Type' and browse through the different data types that are most commonly used in language-related research.\n\n![Screenshot from the IRIS database search page (accessed on 17 April 2024)](images/IRISDataTypes.png){#fig-IRISDataTypes fig-alt=\"Data Type filter dropdown menu with the following visible categories: Oral production (168), Closed response format (157), Open response (105), Judgements (97), Written production (76), Reaction times (62), Qualitative (46)\" width=\"250\"}\n\na\\) For which kinds of studies could these different types of data have been collected? Think about both experimental and observational studies.\n\nb\\) Which of these data types is most likely to be measured in milliseconds (ms)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_69491\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_69491()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"\" name=\"answer_69491\"/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Check answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_69491\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_69491() {var x, text; var x = document.forms['form_69491']['answer_69491'].value;if (x == 'Reaction times'|x == 'reaction times'|x == 'Reaction time'|x == 'Reaction Time'|x == 'Reaction Times'|x == 'reaction'|x == 'Reaction'|x == 'reaction time'){text = 'Yes, well done!';} else {text = 'No, check the list of data types on IRIS.';} document.getElementById('result_69491').innerHTML = text; evaluate_final_score(); return false;}function evaluate_final_score(){\n         element = document.getElementById('checkdown_final_score');\n         if(element === null){return false;} else {var element, text, res1;res1 = document.getElementById('result_69491').innerText == 'Yes, well done!';text = res1;element.innerHTML = text;\n         return false;\n         }}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Types of research data {#sec-ResearchData}\n\nGiven the wide range of methods used in language research, it is no surprise that they are so many different types of research data. Although the data types listed on the IRIS search page (see @fig-IRISDataTypes for extract) are very broad and the categories not clearly defined, the list illustrates the breadth of research data types typically analysed in language studies.\n\nThe first data type category, \"Oral production\", for instance, can equally refer to text transcriptions of language users' oral production, audio, or video files. It can also refer to either raw data or to (more or less) processed data. For example, a transcript of a conversation could have been automatically annotated for part-of-speech, meaning that every word would be marked for their word class (e.g., `This_DT is_VBZ not_RB raw_JJ text_NN data_NN ._PUNC`), or it could have been manually anonymised by adding placeholders (e.g., `Is <NAME> going out with <NAME>?`) indicating that certain words have been retracted for data protection reasons.\n\nThe second most frequent data type category, \"Closed response format\", includes different kinds of questionnaires and tests. Questionnaires may ask study participants to disclose personal information relevant to the research questions using single or multiple-choice questions, such as what language(s) they use at home, how long they have studied a language for, or how old they are. Tests may be designed to assess participants' language competences (e.g., in the form of a vocabulary or grammar test), as well as other aspects relevant to the research questions being investigated (e.g., short-term memory or baseline reaction times).\n\nIn this book we will focus on the research processes that take place after the data have been collected. However, it is vital that we are aware of the conditions and context in which the data we are analysing were collected and pre-processed. It is no exaggeration to say that these steps in the research process can entirely change the results of the data analysis. Suppose we decide to compare the abilities of two groups of French L2 learners. To do this, we administered a language production test to two whole classes of secondary school students learning French as a second language using two different teaching methods. If one group had 15 minutes to complete the test and the other had up to 60 minutes, the results would not be comparable.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Quiz time! {.unnumbered}\n\n[**Q2.1**]{style=\"color:green;\"} Which other reasons could potentially jeopardise the comparison of test results data from two different groups of pupils?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_52656\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_52656()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"answer_52656_1\" value=\"One group having a classroom decorated with French flags and posters about France.\"/>\n<label>One group having a classroom decorated with French flags and posters about France.</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"answer_52656_2\" value=\"One group having French lessons on Tuesday mornings, the other on Friday afternoons.\"/>\n<label>One group having French lessons on Tuesday mornings, the other on Friday afternoons.</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"answer_52656_3\" value=\"One group having a higher proportion of pupils with reading difficulties.\"/>\n<label>One group having a higher proportion of pupils with reading difficulties.</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"answer_52656_4\" value=\"One group having a single native speaker of French, whilst the other has none.\"/>\n<label>One group having a single native speaker of French, whilst the other has none.</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"answer_52656_5\" value=\"One group having a higher proportion of pupils from migrant families.\"/>\n<label>One group having a higher proportion of pupils from migrant families.</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"answer_52656_6\" value=\"The two groups having different teachers.\"/>\n<label>The two groups having different teachers.</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Check answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_52656\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_52656() {var text; var x1 = document.getElementById('answer_52656_1'); var x2 = document.getElementById('answer_52656_2'); var x3 = document.getElementById('answer_52656_3'); var x4 = document.getElementById('answer_52656_4'); var x5 = document.getElementById('answer_52656_5'); var x6 = document.getElementById('answer_52656_6'); if (x1.checked == true&x2.checked == true&x3.checked == true&x4.checked == true&x5.checked == true&x6.checked == true){text = 'That’s right!

Can you think of ways to ensure that these factors are controlled for?';text = res1 + res2;element.innerHTML = text;\n         return false;\n         }}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWhilst there are many ways to ensure that as many factors as possible are controlled for, not all *can* be controlled for. What is crucial is that all aspects of the data collection process are well documented so that all factors, whether controlled or not, can be taken into account when analysing the data.\n\nIn research, we usually distinguish between **primary data**, which is the data that you collected yourself, and **secondary data**, which is data that was collected by others. Hence if you were to carry out a new study based on data that you found on IRIS, you would be conducting a secondary data analysis. Especially when conducting secondary data analyses, it is crucial that we have enough information about the data itself, i.e. **metadata**. Metadata is crucial for finding, sharing, evaluating, and reusing datasets. Metadata can be generated automatically and stored within the data file. For example, unless this metadata was explicitly deleted or amended, Microsoft Word files typically contain metadata describing who created the file, when it was first created, and when the file was last modified. For some data and projects, it also makes sense to create separate metadata files that contain additional or more detailed information about the collected data.\n\n## Data formats and file extensions {#sec-FileExtensions}\n\nDifferent data types come in different data formats. For audio files, you may be familiar with the MP3 format, but this is by no means the only format in which audio files can be saved. Many other audio file formats exist, such as Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE) and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC).\n\nWe can usually tell in what format a file is in by looking at its file extension. The file extension is the suffix of the file name. It comes at the end of the file name and is preceded by a dot. The file extension of a WAVE file is `.wav`, whereas that of an MP3 file is `.mp3`; hence the file `recording.wav` is a WAVE file, whereas `recording.mp3` is an MP3 file.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Quiz time! {.unnumbered}\n\n[**Q2.2**]{style=\"color:green;\"} In which format are Microsoft Word files typically saved?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_2\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_2()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_1\" value=\".odt\"/>\n<label>.odt</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_2\" value=\".docx\"/>\n<label>.docx</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_3\" value=\".docs\"/>\n<label>.docs</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_4\" value=\".msword\"/>\n<label>.msword</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Check answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_2\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_2() {var x, text; var x = document.forms['form_2']['answer_2'].value;if (x == '.docx'){text = 'That’s right!

Sharing materials ensures that studies can be replicated, for example with new participants or in a different language. Sharing research data also allows independent researchers to reproduce the results of studies, allowing them to verify the reported results and to conduct additional analyses that may confirm, contradict, or extend the conclusions of the original studies.\n\nYou may be wondering how linguists and language education researchers can make their research data and materials publicly available. @tbl-RepoTable provides a non-exhaustive list of public repositories where researchers can upload research data and materials (with figures collected in early June 2024[^2_data-1]). Some are specific to the language sciences, while others cater to all research disciplines. If you completed the first task in @sec-DataLanguageSciences, you should already be familiar with at least one of these! 😉 All of the examples, tasks, and exercises in this book are based on research data and materials that researchers have made available in open access on one or more of these repositories.\n\n[^2_data-1]: Note that, for some repositories, the number of entries includes other types of research outputs, e.g., preprints and figures.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-RepoTable .cell tbl-cap='Non-exhaustive list of public repositories of research data and materials.'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                                               Repository        Discipline\n1                                                   Dryad               All\n2                                                Figshare               All\n3                                                     HAL               All\n4                                       Harvard Dataverse               All\n5                                                    IRIS       Linguistics\n6                            Open Science Repository, OSF               All\n7 Tromsø Repository of Language and Linguistics, TROLLing       Linguistics\n8                                                   Vivil Clinical research\n9                                                  Zenodo               All\n  Nb. of entries Provides DOI Online since\n1          60000          Yes         2008\n2        8000000          Yes         2012\n3        5000000           No         2001\n4         160000          Yes         2006\n5           3500           No         2011\n6         153663          Yes         2012\n7           4500          Yes         2014\n8           7000          Yes         2013\n9        3750000          Yes         2013\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the following tasks, we will look at a study by @schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018 (see @fig-SchimkeTitle), which is an example of a publication which was awarded the Open Data and the Open Materials badges (see @fig-OpenDataOpenMaterials).

Consider the following two sentences from the experiment:\n\n> 1.  *El barrendero se encontró con el cartero antes de que recogiera las cartas.*\\\n>     \\[The street sweeper met the postman before he fetched the letters.\\]\n>\n> 2.  *El barrendero se encontró con el cartero antes de que recogiera la escoba.*\\\n>     \\[The street sweeper met the postman before he fetched the broom.\\]\n\nUp until the point at which either *las cartas* \\[the letters\\] or *la escoba* \\[the broom\\] are heard, it is unclear who is doing the fetching. From a grammatical point of view, it could be either the street sweeper or the postman.\n\nParticipants were presented with @fig-Playmobil as they were listening to either Sentence 1 or Sentence 2. At the same time, the researchers measured how long it took for the participants to look at the subject governing the verb *recogiera*. In other words, for Sentence 1, they were interested in how long it took participants to focus on the postman Playmobil figure and, in Sentence 2, on the street sweeper. Such fine measurements are made in milliseconds, i.e. in thousandths of seconds, using a special eye-tracking device.\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\n#### Task 2.2\n\nImagine that you want to run an experiment similar to the one carried out in @schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018.

It forms part of the study's supplementary materials and can also be downloaded from the [IRIS database](https://iris-database.org/details/lYT9m-a75tV).\n\nIn this table, each row corresponds to the data associated with one participant's eye movements while listening to a single stimulus sentence and looking at the corresponding Playmobil image (e.g., @fig-Playmobil). The extract displayed as @tbl-EyeTrackingTable only shows the data associated with the first six stimulus sentences (`items`) that participant \"s1\", a Spanish L2 learner, listened to. The columns `crit1`, `crit2` and `crit3` contain values derived from the measurements made using the eye-tracking device.[^2_data-2] From @tbl-EyeTrackingTable, we can also see that participant \"s1\" was 19 years old when they started formally learning Spanish (`AoO` stands for \"age of onset of formal instruction\") and that they were 20 when the experiment was conducted.\n\n[^2_data-2]: Details of what these values mean are not relevant here but, for those of you who are curious, they correspond to the \"log odds of looks\" that participant made towards one or the other Playmobil figure whilst listening to the experimental stimulus sentences at three time points, called \"critical regions\". These critical regions include the time window between the onset of the pronoun and 480 milliseconds after the onset of the disambiguating information. @schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018 [p. 768-769] explain that \"\\[a\\] positive value of the log odds indicates more looks to the subject than to the object antecedent, while a negative value indicates the reverse pattern.\"\n\n\n::: {#tbl-EyeTrackingTable .cell tbl-cap='Extract of table containing eye-tracking data from Schimke et al.

Data stored in tables are called **tabular data**. Hence, learning to work with tabular data is a crucial data literacy skill.\n\nIn the language sciences, the results of most studies (whether experimental or corpus studies) are stored in tables. For example, when researchers conduct an online survey, the data collected by the online survey platform (e.g., [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com), [SoSci](https://www.soscisurvey.de/), [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)) is automatically stored in the form of one or more table(s). These can then be exported from the survey platform in various tabular file formats (e.g., `.csv`, `.json`, `.xlsx`).\n\nIn some cases, data may be collected by analogue means, e.g., by getting participants to answer a paper questionnaire or collecting school children's work on paper. However, for quantitative analysis, analogue research data are first digitalised. Then, the data are typically stored as text files in file formats such as `.txt` or `.csv`.\n\n### Delimiter-separated values (DSV) files {#sec-DSV}\n\nTables can be stored in many data formats but the simplest and most widely used in linguistic research are **text files with** **delimiter-separated values (DSV)**. For sharing and archiving research data, DSV files are favoured over formats specific to propriety software such as `.xslx` (Microsoft Excel files) or `.numbers` (Apple Numbers files). This is because DSV files can be \"understood\" by many different programs and on all operating systems. The fact that they are simple text files means that we will also be able to reliably read them in the future, even if programs such as Excel or Numbers have evolved or have been discontinued. Reliability and compatibility are fundamental to maintaining the integrity of research data and ensuring that data can be reused, even in the distant future.\n\nIn DSV files, each value (e.g., measurement or response) is separated by a specific **separator** character. In principle, any character can be used to separate values, but the most common separators are the comma (`,`), tab (`\\t`), colon (`:`), and semicolon (`;`). Below is the `.csv` file corresponding to @tbl-RepoTable.\n\n```         \nRepository,Discipline,Nb. of entries,Provides DOI,Online since\nDryad,All,60000,Yes,2008\nFigshare,All,8000000,Yes,2012\nHAL,All,5000000,No,2001\nHarvard Dataverse,All,160000,Yes,2006\nIRIS,Linguistics,3500,No,2011\n\"Open Science Repository, OSF\",All,153663,Yes,2012\n\"Tromsø Repository of Language and Linguistics,TROLLing\",Linguistics,4500,Yes,2014\nVivil,Clinical research,7000,Yes,2013\nZenodo,All,3750000,Yes,2013\n```\n\nAs you can see, the values are separated by commas.[^2_data-3] Additionally, some of the values are enclosed in, or **delimited** by, double quotation marks (`\"`). This prevents any commas that may occur within an actual field value, e.g., the comma in the field `Open Science Repository, OSF`, from being interpreted as a separator character.\n\n[^2_data-3]: Note that the file extension `.csv` stands for \"comma-separated values\". Confusingly, however, DSV files are often given a `.csv` extension even when the separator character is not the comma. As a result, even though the `.tsv` extension stands for \"tab-separated values\", `.csv` files are frequently separated by a tab (`\\t`) rather than comma. Isn't that fun? 🙃\n\nGiven that DSV files are text files, it is possible to open them in a free plain-text editor (e.g., [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)) or a text-processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer). However, these programmes will typically display DSV files as in @fig-DSVinWord.\n\n![The `.csv` file corresponding to @tbl-RepoTable opened in Microsoft Word](images/DSVinWord.png){#fig-DSVinWord fig-alt=\"A screenshot showing a CSV file opened in Microsoft Word. It looks like a long list of words separated by commas.\" width=\"562\"}\n\nWe can probably agree that what we are seeing in @fig-DSVinWord is not a very reader-friendly way to display tabular data! This is why DSV files are more often opened in spreadsheet programs (e.g., LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Numbers) than in text-editing programs. Let's find out how in the next section.\n\n### Opening DSV files in LibreOffice Calc {#sec-DSVLibreOffice}\n\nThere are several ways to open a DSV file in LibreOffice Calc but the safest is to launch LibreOffice (see Task 1 in @sec-OpenSource if you have not yet installed LibreOffice) and, from the list of options under 'Create', click on 'Calc Spreadsheet' to open up a blank spreadsheet. Then, from the 'File' drop-down menu, select 'Open...' or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + O` and locate the DSV file that you wish to open.\n\nOn opening a DSV file in LibreOffice Calc, we get a dialogue box with various options (see @fig-DSVImportCalc).\n\n![Text import dialogue in LibreOfficeCalc](images/DSVImportCalc.png){#fig-DSVImportCalc fig-alt=\"A screenshot showing the text import dialogue in LibreOffice Calc. It shows that the checkbox for comma is checked and that the string delimiter is set to double quotation mark. All other checkboxes are unchecked.\" width=\"450\"}\n\nTo correctly import this particular DSV file, it is necessary to specify that the separator character is the comma (`,`) and that the delimiter character is the double quotation mark (`\"`) (see selected options in @fig-DSVImportCalc). With these settings in LibreOffice Calc, the table is rendered as in @fig-DSVinCalc.\n\n![CSV file opened in LibreOffice Calc](images/DSVinCalc.png){#fig-DSVinCalc fig-alt=\"A screenshot showing a CSV file opened in LibreOffice Calc. It is formatted as a table.\" width=\"601\"}\n\nNote that if you open a DSV file in Excel or Google Sheets, you will not be shown such a dialogue box. Instead, these programs assume that they can guess which separator and delimiter characters your file uses. Whilst this may, at first, sound convenient, this is *not* good news: *you* should be the one in control of how your data files are interpreted, not the program! In the next section, you will learn why opening DSV files such as `.csv` and `.tsv` files in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers can be very dangerous. In some cases, these programs will 'corrupt', i.e. permanently damage, your DSV files, which can lead to irreversible data loss!\n\nThe bad news is that, if you are using Windows or MacOS, it is very likely that either Excel or Numbers is your default app to open DSV files. This means that if you double click on a `.csv` and `.tsv` file in your Finder/Explorer window, the file will likely automatically open up in either Excel or Numbers. This is why it is important you do *not* double-click on such files to open them: Opening a file just *once* with these programs can lead to data loss! If this happens to you with a file that you have downloaded from a repository, your best bet is to delete your local version of the file and download a fresh version so that you can start again from scratch.\n\n:::: callout-caution\n#### Task 2.3\n\nIn this task, we will practice opening a DSV file in LibreOffice Calc. Our example file is a real dataset from @schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018. We will begin by downloading it from the public repository [IRIS](https://iris-database.org/search/?s_publicationAPAInlineReference=Schimke%20et%20al.%20(2018)).\n\nIn addition to the eye-tracking experiments, @schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018 conducted two further experiments in which participants completed a gap-filling task via an online survey platform. In the first of these experiments, the participants were native (L1) speakers of French, German, and Spanish. In the second, they were French- and Spanish-speaking learners (L2) of German.\n\nIn both experiments, the L1 and L2 participants were shown ambiguous sentences similar to the ones used in the eye-tracking experiment with the Playmobil images (see @nte-Eyetracking). After having read each stimulus, the participants were asked to complete a gap-fill task according to their understanding of the preceding ambiguous sentence. Participants were told \"that there were no incorrect responses and that they should answer spontaneously\" [@schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018: 755]. Below is an example questionnaire item in the three languages examined:\n\n<div>\n\n> 1\\. *Der Briefträger ist dem Straßenfeger begegnet, bevor er schnell ein Sandwich geholt hat. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ hat ein Sandwich geholt.*\n>\n> 2\\. *Le facteur a rencontré le balayeur avant qu'il prenne rapidement un sandwich. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ a pris un sandwich.*\n>\n> *3a. El cartero se reunió con el barrendero antes de que él recogiera velozmente un emparedado. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ recogió un emparedado.*\n>\n> 3b. *El cartero se reunió con el barrendero antes de que recogiera velozmente un emparedado. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ recogió un emparedado.*\n\n</div>\n\nNote that, for Spanish, there were two types of stimuli: one with an overt pronoun (as in 3a. with *él*) and one without (as in 3b. with a null pronoun), as both variants are possible in Spanish. All three examples translate as:\n\n> -   *The postman encountered the street sweeper before he quickly fetched a sandwich. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ fetched a sandwich.*\n\nTo complete the gap, participants could either select 'The postman' or 'The street sweeper'.\n\n1.  Go back to the study's page on [IRIS](https://iris-database.org/search/?s_publicationAPAInlineReference=Schimke%20et%20al.%20(2018)) and select the second entry entitled 'Other questionnaire' which, among other things, contains 'Written production data'.\n\nNote that this database entry includes both research data and research materials: the file `sentences_offline_task.xlsx` contains the full list of questionnaire items, including both experimental and filler items, with which we could reconstruct the experiment to replicate it with a new set of participants. For now, however, we are not interested in obtaining materials to replicate the study, but rather in examining the study's original data.\n\nThis [IRIS entry](https://iris-database.org/details/lYT9m-a75tV) also contains three data files. The last file (`logoddslearnersfinal.txt`) is the DSV file that was used to create @tbl-EyeTrackingTable above.\n\nIn this task, we are going to look at the questionnaire data corresponding to the gap-filling task experiment conducted with German L2 learners, which is contained in the data file `offlinedataLearners.txt`:\n\n2.  Download the `offlinedataLearners.txt` file (which is the second listed) and save it on your computer (see @sec-FoldersPaths).\n3.  Launch LibreOffice (see @sec-OpenSource if you have not yet installed LibreOffice) and, from the list of options under 'Create', click on 'Calc Spreadsheet' to open up a blank spreadsheet.\n4.  From the 'File' drop-down menu, select 'Open...' or use the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl/Cmd + O'. Find `offlinedataLearners.txt` in the folder where you saved it and click on 'Open'.\n5.  A 'Text Import' dialogue box will pop up. This a DSV file, not a fixed-width file, so ensure that the option 'Separated by' is selected. If not already set by default, it is also a good idea to select 'Unicode (UTF-8)' for the 'Character set'.\n6.  Experiment with the different 'Separator Options' until the preview at the bottom of the dialogue box looks like a table.\n7.  Ensure that, apart from the 'Separator Options', all other options in the dialogue box are unselected and then click on 'OK'.\n\n#### Quiz time! {.unnumbered}\n\n[**Q2.4**]{style=\"color:green;\"} What is the separator character in the file `offlinedataLearners.txt`?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_88266\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_88266()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88266\" id=\"answer_88266_1\" value=\"Tab\"/>\n<label>Tab</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88266\" id=\"answer_88266_2\" value=\"Comma\"/>\n<label>Comma</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88266\" id=\"answer_88266_3\" value=\"Semicolon\"/>\n<label>Semicolon</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88266\" id=\"answer_88266_4\" value=\"Space\"/>\n<label>Space</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88266\" id=\"answer_88266_5\" value=\"All of them\"/>\n<label>All of them</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Check answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_88266\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_88266() {var x, text; var x = document.forms['form_88266']['answer_88266'].value;if (x == 'Tab'){text = 'That’s right!';} else {text = 'That’s incorrect.

Instead, first launch Excel and create a new blank workbook. Then navigate to the 'Data' tab, select the 'Get Data' option, and then 'From Text/CSV' (see @fig-ExcelGetData). In the following dialogue, you can specify how the data should be imported. The options are very similar to the ones offered in LibreOffice (see above).\n\nNote that with this method it *may* be possible to prevent Excel from automatically (and irreversibly!) applying transformations to your data. However, sadly, this may not suffice. Read on to find out more...\n\n![Import data into excel](images/ExcelGetData.png){#fig-ExcelGetData fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the option to import data into excel from an Text/CSV file. It can be found under 'Get Data', 'From File', and 'From Text/CSV'. The info message for this option reads 'Import data from a text, comma-separated value or formatted text (space-delimited) file.'\" width=\"453\"}\n:::\n\n## A word of warning about spreadsheet programs ⚠️ {#sec-ExcelWarning}\n\nYou should be aware that opening DSV files in spreadsheet programs can corrupt the files! Once a file is corrupted, it is often not possible to retrieve the original data so this is very bad news, indeed. Such problems are particularly frequent when opening DSV files with Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. This is because the default settings in these programs surreptitiously modify files upon opening.\n\nThese 'auto-format' modifications include replacing certain values by dates (e.g., changing `3-4` to `March, 4th`) or numbers (e.g., changing `1.23E5` to `123000`)[^2_data-4], removing leading zeros (e.g., changing `001` to `1`), or misinterpreting certain characters (e.g., the value `-ism` will generate an error because the hyphen is interpreted as minus sign).\n\n[^2_data-4]: In scientific notation, \"E\" stands for \"exponent\", which refers to the number of times a number needs to be multiplied by 10. This notation is used as a shorthand way of writing very large or very small numbers. This is why \"1.23E5\" is interpreted by Excel as 1.23 multiplied by 10 to the power of 5, which is to say: 1.23 multiplied by 100,000. This operation shifts the decimal point five places to the right, resulting in the number 123000.\n\nNot only can these auto-format modifications lead to inaccurate data analysis but, in the worst of cases, they can even cause data loss. The crux of the problem is that often users do not realise what the program has done in the background. How bad can this be? Find out by completing the task below.\n\n::: callout-caution\n#### Task 2.4\n\nIn this task, you will find out how genetics researchers who use spreadsheets for their analyses regularly have their data so badly damaged that it affects the results of their publication. Though we have no statistics on how spreadsheet errors affect the work of linguists, it is (unfortunately) very likely to be just as bad as in genetics.\n\n@ziemannGeneNameErrors2016 reported that a fifth of genetics publications with supplementary `.xls` or `.xlsx` files with gene lists contained errors caused by Excel's auto-formatting behaviour. The results of this study shocked the research community and a report about it went viral.

To ensure that this does not happen to you, check that Excel is *definitely not* your default app to open `.csv` and `.tsv` files (see below for instructions).\n\n::::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Opening a `.csv` or `.tsv` file in LibreOffice from a File Finder/Explorer window {#sec-DefaultApp}\n\nRemember that to open a `.csv` or `.tsv` file on your computer, should *never ever* double-click on it and let the default program open it! As we saw in @sec-ExcelWarning, this can break or 'corrupt' the file. To avoid accidentally double-clicking on a `.csv` or `.tsv` file and having the file corrupted, I recommend making either [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or a plain-text editor (e.g., [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)) your default application to open up such files.\n\nOn **MacOS**, you can change the default application used to open files of any file extensions by right-clicking a file name with this particular extension and than selecting 'Get Info' (@fig-ChangeDefaultAppMac01). In the example below, Numbers is the default application for all `.csv` files (see @fig-ChangeDefaultAppMac02). In the dropdown menu 'Open with:', you can then select LibreOffice (provided you have installed it beforehand!) and finally click on 'Change All...' (@fig-ChangeDefaultAppMac03).
