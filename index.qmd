# Preface {.unnumbered}

::: callout-warning
## Warning

This textbook draft is very much **work in progress**. I intend to progressively add to it over the course of the summer semester 2024.

This zero draft is primarily intended as revision materials for my M.A. class "More than counting words: Introduction to statistics and data visualisation for linguists", which I regularly teach at the University of Cologne.

Note that the PDF version is not optimised in any way. For now, I recommend only looking at the web-book version available on: <https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/>.

Student and colleague feedback on this first draft is very welcome!

## What is this book about?

This textbook is intended as a hands-on introduction to data management, statistics, and data visualisation for students and researchers in the language sciences. It relies exclusively on freely accessible, open-source tools, focusing primarily on the programming language and environment `R`.

It is often claimed that learning `R` is "not for everyone", or that it has "a steep learning curve". This textbook aims to prove that the opposite is true. There are many reasons why it is worth investing the time and effort to learn how to do research in `R`, and it is no more difficult than learning any other new skill. In fact, the results of a recent study suggests that language aptitude is a much stronger predictor of programming aptitude than numeracy (i.e., "being good at numbers") [@pratRelatingNaturalLanguage2020].

> "Learning R is like learning a foreign language. If you enjoy learning languages, then ‘R’ is just another one. \[...\] You have to learn vocabulary, grammar and syntax. Similar to learning a new language, programming languages also have steep learning curves and require quite some commitment." [@dauberNonProgrammersGuideSocial2024]

The rationale for this textbook is based on my personal observations, in both teaching and consulting, that many 'introductory' textbooks to statistics and/or `R` are not suitable for many humanities scholars, who typically have little to no prior programming experience and for whom the word "statistics" often evokes little more than unpleasant memories of school mathematics. It's worth stressing that is not a matter of generation (I have observed this phenomenon across all age groups), intelligence (I have taught people far more intelligent than me), or an innate inability to deal with numbers and/or computers (although these are beliefs that, sadly, some have internalised). Instead, I am convinced that, for many people, it is simply a matter of finding a good stepping stone to begin this learning journey.

The aim of this textbook is by no means to replace any of the brilliant, existing textbooks aimed at imparting statistical literacy for linguistics research, but rather to provide a stepping stone to be able to access these wonderful resources.[^index-1]

## Who is this book for? {.unnumbered}

The target audience for this book are students and researchers in the language sciences, which includes (applied) linguistics, (first and second) language teaching, and language education research. All examples will be taken from these research areas. Ultimately, however, this textbook may be of use to anyone who feels they could benefit from a maximally accessible stepping stone, whichever discipline they are coming from.

This textbook is intended to be read chapter by chapter. Most chapters will require several hours of work. Completing the tasks and quiz questions is essential to genuinely understand the contents. The best way to learn new skills is to try things out! With this in mind, let's get cracking!

## About the author

I started learning about statistics and `R` in 2017 when I realised that it would be important for me to perform the kind of quantitative analyses that I wanted to do as part of my PhD in applied linguistics/English language teaching [@LeFollTextbookEnglishCorpusBased2022]. I had no previous experience in either and there were no such courses at my university. Even though I mostly learnt by myself, it would be incorrect to say that I am self-taught: I learnt from some of the resources listed in [Appendix A](#sec-AppendixA), attended bootcamps and summer schools, and countless posts on StackOverflow, various blogs, and exchanged with like-minded people on social media ([#Rstats](https://mastodon.social/tags/rstats), [#dataviz](https://mastodon.social/tags/dataviz), [#TidyTuesday](https://mastodon.social/tags/tidytuesday)). This why it is fairer to say that I am community-taught.

I now describe myself as an "advanced beginner" in `R` and statistics. I am not a programmer, nor a statistician, but rather an applied linguist and committed educator. I enjoy teaching data literacy, statistics, and data visualisation to current and future generations of linguists, language education scholars, and teachers. I teach regular methods courses at the University of Cologne that are attended not just by M.A. and M.Ed. students, but also by some doctoral and post-doctoral researcher colleagues. I also teach workshops for both doctoral and post-doctoral researchers at other institutions on a freelance basis. This textbook was partly designed on the basis of materials that I have developed for these courses and workshops. Publishing these materials is my way to contribute to the wonderful community of people who helped me on my lea`R`ning journey.

I chose this picture because I vividly remember two professors pointing out that I had written "*p* = 0.00" on my poster[^index-2] and laughing among themselves (but well within earshot) at how stupid that was. Learning these skills certainly requires a lot of effort on the part of the learner, but it also requires an academic culture that strives to include rather than exclude. This textbook explicitly aims for an inclusive approach to teaching the basics of data literacy and I have included this photo as a reminder to always persevere, whether in the face of seemingly insurmountable error message or snarky remarks!
