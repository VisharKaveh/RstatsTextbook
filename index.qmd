# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Warning

This textbook draft is very much **work in progress**. I intend to progressively add to it over the course of the summer semester 2024. Note that the PDF version is not optimised in any way. For now, I recommend only looking at the web-book version available on: <https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/>.

This first draft is intended as complementary materials to my M.A. class "More than counting words: Introduction to statistics and data visualisation for linguists", which I teach at the University of Cologne.

Student feedback on this first draft is very welcome!

## Who is this book for? {.unnumbered}

This textbook is intended as a very gentle introduction to basic principles of data literacy, statistics, and data visualisation using the programming language and environment `R`. The target audience are students and researchers in the language sciences, including (applied) linguistics, (first and second) language teaching, and language education research. The rationale for this textbook is based on my personal observations, in teaching and consulting both students and researcher colleagues, that many 'introductory' textbooks assume previous knowledge and skills that not all have or go through contents at too fast a pace for many humanities scholars who often come with little to no experience with programming and/or statistics.

The aim of this textbook is by no means to replace any of the brilliant existing textbooks aimed at imparting statistical literacy for linguistics research, but rather to provide a stepping stone towards being able to make the most of these wonderful existing resources. A (work-in-progress) list of next-step resources is included in [Appendix A](https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/FurtherResources.html).
