    "text": "Who is this book for?\nThis textbook is intended as a very gentle introduction to basic principles of data management, statistics, and data visualisation using the programming language and environment `R`. The target audience are students and researchers in the language sciences, including (applied) linguistics, language teaching, and language education research. The rationale for this textbook is based on my personal observations, in teaching and consulting both students and researcher colleagues, that many so-called ‘introductory’ textbooks assume previous knowledge and skills that all have or go through contents at too fast a pace for many humanities scholars who often come with little to no experience with programming and/or statistics.\nThe aim of this textbook is by no means to replace any of the brilliant existing textbooks aimed at imparting statistical literacy for linguistics research, but rather to provide a stepping stone towards being able to make the most of these wonderful existing resources. A (work-in-progress) list of next-step resources is included in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst",

    "text": "1.1 Open Source\nIn line with its aim to provide an accessible introduction to statistics and data visualisation, this textbook relies exclusively on open-source software and programming languages, foremost LibreOffice Calc, R and RStudio. Open source refers to software whose source code is available under a license that grants anyone the rights to study, modify, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. If we think of a software application as a cake, the source code is like its recipe. It contains the list of ingredients and the steps to bake the cake. Open source means that the recipe is publicly available. You can access it, read it, and use it to bake the cake. You can also modify it to add your own twist, such as adding a new ingredient or making it vegan, and share it with others. In the context of software, this allows many people to collaborate, make improvements, and share their versions, resulting in better and more diverse software.\nUsing open-source software in this introductory textbook means that anyone2 can download, install and use the required software at no cost. However, it is very important to note that not all free software (freeware) is open source. Let us illustrate the difference by comparing different spreadsheet programmes as, in the following chapter, we will begin exploring tabular data structures in a spreadsheet programme.\nThe most most widely used spreadsheet programme to date is undoubtedly Microsoft Excel. Excel is a commercial, proprietary spreadsheet editor which forms part of the Microsoft 365 package. As such, to use Excel on your personal computer, you need to buy a license or be a member of an organisation (e.g., your university or company) that pays for such a license. It is true that Microsoft now also offers a free (functionally limited) web-based version of Excel, yet this still does not make it open source. This is because Microsoft does not share the source code of any Excel version, which means that, even if they are giving away free cake, we do not have the recipe to bake the cake ourselves should the company decide to start charging money for the cake or to no longer distribute it at all! Similarly, you may be familiar with a popular, web-based alternative to Excel: Google Sheets. Whilst it is (currently) free to use, as the name suggests, Google Sheets is owned by Google and is therefore not open source, either. By contrast, LibreOffice Calc is a project of The Document Foundation (TDF) that provides a popular, free, open-source office productivity software suite comparable to Microsoft 365 called LibreOffice. LibreOffice is developed collaboratively by very many different people across the world who all do so on a volunteer basis. The Document Foundation estimates that there are 200 million active LibreOffice users worldwide, about 25% of whom are thought to be students (figures from 2018 see 2024). Its popularity is likely due to the fact that it not only uses open formats (e.g., .odt and .ods), but can also open and save to a range of popular formats including those used by Microsoft (e.g., .docx and .xlsx).",
