// Description of dataset: 

This dataset contains one data file (.csv) used to create the tables in the paper "Diverging grammaticalization patterns across Spanish varieties: the case of 'perdón' in Mexican and Peninsular Spanish". The data used to investigate the contemporary uses of the apology marker 'perdón' come from a sizeable, manually annotated corpus consisting of spoken spontaneous conversations and interviews, recorded during the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st century. The following list of existing, spoken corpora were exploited: Corpus del Proyecto para el Estudio Sociolingüístico del Español de España y de América (PRESEEA), América y España español coloquial (AMERESCO), Corpus Sociolingüístico de la Ciudad de México (CSCM), Corpus del Habla de Baja California (CHBC) and Corpus Michoacano del Español (CME) for Mexican Spanish and Corpus Oral de Madrid (CORMA), Valencia Español Coloquial (Val.Es.Co.), Corpus Oral de Referencia del Español Contemporáneo (CORLEC), Corpus integrado de referencia en lenguas romances (C-ORAL-ROM) and Corpus del Proyecto para el Estudio Sociolingüístico del Español de España y de América (PRESEEA) for Peninsular Spanish. The data file includes all occurrences of 'perdón' ('sorry') together with its near-synonymous apologetic markers such as 'lo siento' ('I am sorry') and forms derived from the performative verbs 'perdonar' ('to forgive') and 'disculpar' ('to apologize'). It contains a total of 769 occurrences: 363 cases for Mexican Spanish and 406 for Peninsular Spanish. The data is annotated for (i) Spanish variety, (ii) corpus, (iii) form, (iv) type of offense, (v) face affected (positive face/negative face) and (vi) orientation of the face (speaker/hearer).

// Description of sources and methods used for collection/generation of data: 
The data used to investigate the contemporary uses of the apology marker 'perdón' come from a sizeable, manually annotated corpus consisting of spoken spontaneous conversations and interviews in two varieties of Spanish (Mexican and Peninsular Spanish), recorded during the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st century.

// Methods for processing the data: 
All instances of the apologetic markers 'lo siento', 'perdón' and forms derived from the verbs 'disculpar' and 'perdonar' were retrieved from the above mentioned corpora.
In a first phase we collected all occurrences of 'perdón' together with its near-synonymous apologetic markers such as 'lo siento' and forms derived from the performative verbs 'perdonar' and 'disculpar'. This first step allowed us to quantitatively assess the overall frequency and productivity of perdón compared with its near-synonymous expressions. Following this objective, we retrieved a total of 769 occurrences: 363 cases for Mexican Spanish and 406 for Peninsular Spanish. From this corpus, we then selected only the instances of 'perdón', yielding a total of 500 instances (299 for Mexico and 201 for Spain) that were subjected to a fine-grained qualitative analysis in order to account for the grammaticalization process of the marker.
